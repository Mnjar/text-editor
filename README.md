# Simple Text Editor using C++

## Description

This project is a simple command-line text editor implemented in C++. The purpose of creating this project was to enhance my understanding of data structures such as stacks and strings, as well as to improve my knowledge and familiarity with C++ programming.

The text editor supports basic functionalities such as:

- Adding text
- Deleting text
- Undo/Redo operations
- Saving text to a file

This project was created solely as a learning exercise to strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- **Add Text**: Append new text to the existing content.
- **Delete Text**: Remove a specified number of characters from the end.
- **Undo/Redo**: Reverse or reapply changes using a stack-based mechanism.
- **Save to File**: Save the current text content to a specified file.
